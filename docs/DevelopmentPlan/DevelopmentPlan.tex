\section{Team Meeting Plan}

Our team will have a meeting weekly on Mondays at 10:30 AM in Thode library.  Should we decide on Monday that we need another meeting that week, we will have a meeting on Thursdays at 2:30 PM, also in Thode.  If more meeting time is still necessary, our group will arrange for a meeting on Friday or over the weekend. 

Meetings with our supervisor, Dr. Sirouspour, will occur biweekly (once every two weeks) on Wednesdays from 11 AM to 12 PM virtually via Teams. 

An agenda will be created and committed to our Git repo prior to meetings.  This responsibility will be assigned to a different team member each week, on a rotation, however, all team members may suggest agenda topics.  The agenda will include suggested meeting topics, who will present/lead each topic, and an estimated time of discussion. Meeting minutes will also be recorded in the same document as the agenda, by the same team member, and be uploaded to our Git repo after the meeting.  This team member will also be responsible for chairing the meeting. 

\section{Team Communication Plan}

Our primary form of fast, short communication will be through our text group chat. We will use Github to post issues and host documentation for deliverables.  In addition to Github, we will also use Trello for project management (Kanban).  Lastly, we will use Team to host virtual meetings.
